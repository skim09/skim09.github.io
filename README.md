# Data Science Portfolio
This repository is a compilation of projects completed related to data analysis/data science during the past year of my education at Wesleyan University. Projects range from applications of network science on airline networks to exploring and discovering patterns in data on a FIFA 19 player dataset.

## Projects:

<a href="https://skim09.github.io/airline-layers">The Role of Airlines in the Analysis of Correlation between Distance and Centrality in Air Transportation</a>
* Network analysis of European flight network with airports as nodes and flight paths as edges
* Exploration of differences in network characteristics if network is filtered by airline
* Focus on geography and centrality measures
* **Keywords** (Python, Network Science, Multiplex Analysis, Centrality Analysis, Flight Data)
